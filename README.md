# Testing / Developing streamlit applications
- This repository is my private workspace for testing / learning /d eveloping streamlit python apps
- This repository is just a proof-of-concept and NOT production-ready code
- This repository is NOT well structured because it's more of a testing / proof-of-concept repository than actual well-structured testing
- I use this repository to learn the streamlit framework and therefore you might see horrible coding and non-functional apllications
